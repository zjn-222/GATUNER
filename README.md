Floating-point arithmetic is widely employed in high-precision computing domains such as national defense, aerospace, and finance. Different applications impose varying precision requirements on floating-point calculations, making it a critical challenge in high-performance programming to maximize program performance while meeting precision constraints. Mixed precision technology, which uses multiple precision types within the same program, has emerged as a common optimization strategy. However, existing search-based methods often suffer from local optima and fail to directly generate usable hybrid-precision programs for users.Leveraging the global search capability of Genetic Algorithms, we propose a GA-based Mixed precision tuning method and develop a tool named GATUNER.
Specifically, GATUNER first analyzes program variables and statements to construct a dependency graph. It then employs the Leiden algorithm to detect community structures within the graph and uses an improved GA to search for optimal mixed precision configurations, finally auto-generating the corresponding mixed precision programs. We evaluated GATUNER on 14 benchmark tests and applications. Experimental results show that GATUNER identified effective mixed precision configurations for 76.79% of the tested programs. Compared with HIFPTUNER, ADAPT, CHEF-FP, and PESA, GATUNER achieved an average performance improvement of 29.59% for the found configurations, outperforming these tools by 12.04%, 22.03%, 13.12%, and 18.67% respectively.
